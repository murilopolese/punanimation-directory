        <h2>WHO</h2>
        <p>Panimation (previously known as Punanimation) was founded in February 2015, by 3 friends: <a href="https://beegrandinetti.com/" target="_blank">Bee Grandinetti</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/hedvigahlberg" target="_blank">Hedvig Ahlberg</a>, and <a href="http://www.linnfritz.com/" target="_blank">Linn Fritz</a>.</p>
        <p>Although we were initially just 3, today our whole community is built by over 6000 women, trans and non-binary friends from all over the world, working within the many different fields and specializations of animation and motion graphics.</p>

        <h2>WHY</h2>
        <p>We were a bit tired of this industry being too much of a boyâ€™s club, so we decided to do something about it.</p>
        <p>Panimation started as a Facebook group, aiming to bring the ladies, trans and non-binary friends together. The community started to expand and our dear members helped shaping it into a lively, inspiring and awesome platform to exchange knowledge and support.</p>
        <p>Since then, we've been receiving so many words of encouragement from our members that it just confirms this was not only the right thing to do, but very much needed.</p>
        <p>This pushed us to work on the next, bigger step: putting together a directory that makes it easy for anyone to get a hold of that talent.</p>
        <p>No more excuses for male-only studios, speaker line-ups and director rosters. Diversity exists, it's got skills and it's here.</p>
